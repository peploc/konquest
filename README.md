## Game Page

![Konquest Game Page](https://github.com/peploc/konquest/blob/master/readmeimg/gameplay1.png)
At the beginning of the game every **Player** has one **Planet** and a specific **Color**.
Others planets on the board are "Free Planets" but that doesn't mean that they are defenceless :)
Every **Planet** has unique characteristics: **Dimension**, **Progress** and **Distruction**. The **Army Production** of each planet depends on these characteristics.


## Game Play

![Konquest Game Play](https://github.com/peploc/konquest/blob/master/readmeimg/gameplay2.png)
Konquest is based on **Turns**.
On bottom-right there is the player indicator that shows all Players Colors and the **Active Player** orange borded.
Active Player can displace his army in his turn.

To send an **attack** first select a planet you own, then select a planet to attack.
to send a **backup** first select a planet you own, then select another planet you own.

You can send all the **ships** from your planet but one.
You can send all shipment you want in your turn.
You can attack a planet you don't own with multiple attack, if one of your attack conquest the planet successives shipment are automatically converted in backup.

**Distance** is really important in Konquest, the more distance between planets the more time needs a shipment.

When active player's done can click on **NEXT TURN** and pass the turn to the next player.
When last player click on NEXT TURN the **TURN** value on top of the side-bar change and a new **TURN** start.
On each new TURN attacks and backups are shown to all players, and all planets owned by players produces his armies.


## End of the Game
